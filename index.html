                        <a href="https://github.com/TheOneMaster/Sentiment-Analysis-for-Airlines">Airline Sentiment Analysis</a>
                         was a project conducted as a part of my course. The goal of this project was to analyze a large dataset of
                         twitter conversations between different airlines and their users. The tweets were examined on the basis of
                         sentiment, which showed the general mood towards the airline. Additionally, the tweet threads were grouped 
                         into conversations between individual users and the repective airline. This allowed to view whether the 
                         replies of airlines to frustrated customers was helping customer sentiment (i.e., improving their mood).

                        This project required the use of 3 major tools: the python library <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">nltk</a>
                        for natural language processing, SQL, and version control in the form of Git. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
                        was essential for this project as we needed to analyze tweets sent from people and determine the sentiment of 
                        the tweet. SQL was used primarily for the storage and retrieval of the data obtained after preprocessing the raw
                        twitter data. And finally, since this project was a collaboration with a group of fellow students, we needed to use
                        Git to keep track of changes made to the code by each individual.
